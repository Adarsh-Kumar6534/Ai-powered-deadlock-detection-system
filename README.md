# 🛠 AI-Powered Deadlock Detection & Resolution Tool

## 🔍 Overview
The **AI-Powered Deadlock Detection & Resolution Tool** is a smart system designed to detect, analyze, and resolve deadlocks in process scheduling.
It leverages **graph theory, AI-based algorithms, and resource allocation strategies** to prevent deadlocks and optimize system performance.

With an intuitive **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** powered by **PyQt6**, the tool provides a **visual representation** of processes, resources, and dependencies, making it easier to analyze and resolve conflicts efficiently.

## 🎯 Key Features
✅ **Graph-Based Deadlock Detection** – Uses **NetworkX** to build a **Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)** and detect cyclic dependencies.  
✅ **Automated Resolution Mechanism** – AI-driven algorithms suggest **process preemption** and **resource reallocation**.  
✅ **Real-Time Visualization** – Interactive GUI displays **process dependencies** and **deadlock resolution** in real-time.  
✅ **Efficient Computation** – Utilizes **NumPy** for fast **matrix operations**.  
✅ **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple **drag-and-drop interaction** for process-resource mapping.  
✅ **Log Generation & Reports** – Keeps track of **detected deadlocks, resolved cases, and system performance**.

## 🚀 Installation
Follow these steps to install dependencies and run the tool:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Adarsh-Kumar6534/deadlock-detection-ai.git
cd deadlock-detection-ai

# Install required dependencies
pip install PyQt6 networkx numpy matplotlib

# Run the application
python src/main.py
```

---

## 🎯 How It Works
1. **Define Process-Resource Dependencies**: Input processes and resources using the interactive GUI.
2. **Graph Construction**: The system creates a Resource Allocation Graph (RAG).
3. **Deadlock Detection**: It checks for cycles using Depth-First Search (DFS) or other algorithms.
4. **Automated Resolution**: AI suggests and executes preemptive actions to resolve the deadlock.
5. **Visualization & Logging**: Updates the UI in real-time and generates log reports.

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- Track **deadlock frequency** and **resolution time**.
- Visualize system performance with **interactive graphs**.
- Generate reports for further analysis.
