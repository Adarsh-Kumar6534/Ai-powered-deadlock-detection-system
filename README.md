# 🛠 AI-Powered Deadlock Detection & Resolution Tool  

## 🔍 Overview  
The **AI-Powered Deadlock Detection & Resolution Tool** is an advanced system designed to detect, analyze, and resolve deadlocks in process scheduling.  
It leverages **graph theory, AI-based algorithms, and resource allocation strategies** to prevent deadlocks and optimize system performance.  

With an intuitive **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** powered by **PyQt6**, the tool provides a **visual representation** of processes, resources, and dependencies, making it easier to analyze and resolve conflicts efficiently.

## 🎯 Key Features  
✅ **Graph-Based Deadlock Detection** – Uses **NetworkX** to build a **Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)** and detect cyclic dependencies.  
✅ **Automated Resolution Mechanism** – AI-driven algorithms suggest **process preemption** and **resource reallocation**.  
✅ **Real-Time Visualization** – Interactive GUI displays **process dependencies** and **deadlock resolution** in real-time.  
✅ **Efficient Computation** – Utilizes **NumPy** for fast **matrix operations**.  
✅ **User-Friendly Interface** – Simple **drag-and-drop interaction** for process-resource mapping.  
✅ **Log Generation & Reports** – Keeps track of **detected deadlocks, resolved cases, and system performance**.

## 🚀 How It Works  

The system follows a **structured five-step process** to ensure efficient **deadlock detection and resolution**:  

1️⃣ **User Input:**  
- Users define **processes and resources** through the GUI interface.  
- Dependencies are mapped between **processes and resources**.  

2️⃣ **Graph Construction:**  
- The tool constructs a **Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)**.  
- **Nodes** represent processes and resources, **edges** define allocations and requests.  

3️⃣ **Deadlock Detection:**  
- The system identifies **cycles in the graph** using **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and other **graph traversal methods**.  
- If a cycle is detected, a **deadlock warning is triggered**.  

4️⃣ **Automated Resolution:**  
- The AI-powered system suggests the **best process/resource to preempt**.  
- Possible solutions include **resource reallocation, priority scheduling, or process termination**.  

5️⃣ **Visualization & Logging:**  
- The **GUI updates dynamically** to show **resolved deadlocks**.  
- A **log file is generated** for system analysis and debugging.
